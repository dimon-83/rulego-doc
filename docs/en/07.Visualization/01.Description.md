## RuleGo-Editor

To help you better understand, use and debug RuleGo features, we have carefully prepared a visual rule chain editor for you: [RuleGo-Editor](/en/pages/c0b811/).

## RuleGo-Server

`RuleGo-Server` is the server for `RuleGo-Editor`, providing HTTP-based API interfaces for managing and executing rule chains, and can be deployed independently as a RuleGo rule engine service.

- Code directory: [examples/server](https://github.com/rulego/rulego/tree/main/examples/server)
- API Documentation: [RuleGo-Server API Documentation](https://apifox.com/apidoc/shared-d17a63fe-2201-4e37-89fb-f2e8c1cbaf40)
